# NOTE
This project is in an extra-raw state.

Some of the things noted in `.markdown` files are wishful thinking.

Tbh dont know if the octtree is even up to that, 
surely the drawing process needs to be better for the
[CSG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry) stuff for instance.

## Data that could be contained:

* Images, where to find images with clear locations(and directions), though!
 + Use it for coloring surfaces, by 'raying'?
 
* Fields: 'overall models' and measurement at location.
 + gravity
 + magnetism (think the variations are not so small relative to the 'constant field'?)

# TODO

* Searching along 'flashlights'

* Test with moving around with perspective, finding pictures in approx the correct direction.

* Make a clear list of most important functions for complete useage. 
  (possibly modifying things to make it neat)

* write test with matrices set up and stuff
 + test expansion and searching in various ways
 
* make the lists do stuff and have the lists expand if needed.
